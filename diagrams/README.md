# Diagram Files
Public files needed to support the [diagrams](https://github.com/EncircleInc/diagrams) repository.

## Structurizr Theme
Our Strucuturizr theme is based on the [default](https://github.com/structurizr/themes/blob/master/default/theme.json) 
and expanded from there to suit our needs.

- `theme.json` Our theme as a theme file.
- `theme.dsl` Our theme encoded as a style block for direct inclusion in a diagram.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Git for Confluence plugin we use to include Structurizr diagrams does not honor a
> theme URL at this time. For now, use the `theme.dsl` instead.
